# Frethya (Hide)
The name (`Frethya`) is an homage to Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle.

## Intro
Frethya is a python script which performs image stegnography by hiding data in an EXIF tag.
This script encodes the user input in `Base64` and hides it in `UserComment` EXIF tag.

Usage: `python3 frethya.py`

This script is useful for passing messages hidden under the hood (EXIF data).

[NOTE:`Base64` is an encoding and not encryption method, hence these messages can be decoded easily.
